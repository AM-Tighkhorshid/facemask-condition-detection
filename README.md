# facemask-condition-detection

In this project, a facemask detection model using is presented. This system consists of two stages. The first stage is the SSD MobileNetV2, and for the second stage, a custom CNN network is used. The seconde stage has been added to improve the accuracy of the classification. The model is also implemented in a real-time gate controlling system using a servo motor and Raspberry Pi 3.

## Training
for training we used FMDD dataset

## Results
sample of detections 

samples of real-time facemask detection with gate controlling results
